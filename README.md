# whatsapp-messager

the legends on stackoverflow and our favourite chatgpt helped me fix the errors in session 3

session 1:
Trying to make an automated whatsapp messenger

session2(only 5 minutes):
I am unable to fix the code :(

session3:
I fixed the code less goooo. db is now connecting but the message is not being sent :(
i think i have to change XPATH

session4:
fixed the XPATH, messages are now being sent. but the problem is they are not being removed from the db. fixing that in the next session....

session5:
everything fixed, code works, database is now being updated
